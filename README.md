# Todo-list webpage
A web based todo-list manager.

# How to set up
To set up the website you can either use the website on a usual webserver or, like i do, create a local php-server and make it automatically start up, when your PC gets booted.
# What does it look like
This is just the TODO-List of an ordinary austrian high school student

Using the 'style_rev_2_.css' stylesheet mobile compatibility is assured and the style looks a lot more pleasing
